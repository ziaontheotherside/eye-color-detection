# 👀 Eye Color Detection using OpenCV & Machine Learning  
*A Work-in-Progress Experiment in Computer Vision!*  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered real-time eye color detection system** using **computer vision and machine learning**. The idea came from a fun debate with a friend about their actual eye color—so I figured, why not build an AI to settle it?  

This is a **work in progress**, and I'm actively improving it! Future updates may include:  
✅ Better accuracy with different lighting conditions  
✅ Deep learning models for improved classification  
✅ A dataset-driven approach for broader testing  

## 🛠 Technologies & Skills Demonstrated  
- **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** → Detects and extracts the eye region from webcam input  
- **Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** → Determines the dominant color in the iris  
- **Image Processing (NumPy)** → Reshapes and processes pixel data for analysis  
- **Real-Time Processing** → Uses live video capture to analyze and display results instantly  

## 📸 How It Works  
1️⃣ The webcam **captures live video**.  
2️⃣ OpenCV **detects eyes** using a pre-trained Haar cascade model.  
3️⃣ The program **extracts the eye region** and finds the **most dominant color** using **K-Means clustering**.  
4️⃣ It **classifies the color** into Blue, Green, Brown, Amber, Gray, or Violet.  
5️⃣ The result is **displayed on-screen** in real-time.  

## 🔧 What’s Probably Next?  
✅ Improving accuracy by factoring in **lighting conditions & reflections**  
✅ Exploring **Deep Learning (CNNs)** instead of K-Means for better results  
✅ Adding **a dataset-driven approach** to handle more eye color variations  
✅ Creating a **web app (Flask/Streamlit)** for easy online testing  

## Why I Built This  
This started as a **fun debate** about whether my friend’s eyes were **blue or green**—turns out, defining colors isn’t as simple as we thought! So, I challenged myself to create an **AI-based solution** to settle the argument once and for all. Rght now, this repository is **private**, as I continue working on it. However, I’m **very open to discussions** about the project, feedback, and ideas for improvement! Feel free to **reach out if you’re interested in the technical details, challenges, or future plans**! Since this is an evolving project, feedback and contributions are welcome! If you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to **open an issue** or **reach out to me directly**.
